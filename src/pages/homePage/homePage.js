        <span>Disclaimer:</span> This is a recollection of the memories and
        incidents that we shared throughout the 4 years of our college. There
        are certain swear words and actions that can be seen in some photos but
        all these were always made in a light mood and were (and are) never
        meant to berate the other person. We've included them to be able to
        accurately remember what happened at that time without any distortions.
        There are also a few religious and political jokes but these jokes do
        not represent our religious or political inclinations and were always
        made as a humour effect based on the then current circumstances and for
        the sake of them being fitting in the premise of the said joke. The idea
        was never to offend any person, entity or organisation.

        We had heard a lot of anecdotes about how college is one of the best
        parts of one's life or how in college one makes friends for life and we
        being the "we're now adults" upstarts, always thought that such things
        happened only in movies. Ohh but little did we know what was in store
        for us! We entered our college and met so many random people, people who
        came and went, people who shared similar interests but not similar ideas
        and sometimes people who left a mark, but through all these 4 years, we
        were glad to also have people who were equally carefree as we were and
        equally scared about ourselves - people who came into each other's lives
        but. fortunately, never left - people who became almost family (almost
        because we know we get bored of family at one point of time but dare we
        say we will ever get bored of each other). This site, another such idea
        that luckily went to the implementation phase, acts as a chronicle and a
        memoir for all the things that we did - stupid and otherwise - and all
        the memories that were shared through these 4 years. People who became
        friends for life and made college the best part of our life.
