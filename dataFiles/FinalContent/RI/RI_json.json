Also, after third semester substantial things had been taught and it was no doubt that December vacation was a nice time to build more skills in programming. _nl__nl_There was also a parallel thought going on in our collective mind, this was the only period were we as a group could have good time together. As the NGO list was announced we consulted some seniors and the second thought became strong and we selected HIFEED Uttarakhand as the place to go. But similar thoughts had crept in across the batch and there was huge demand-supply gap with HIFEED offering only 50 seats. We were fresh out of Economics course and thus we went on to quantify the gap. Groups sat near the E-ground router to discuss others\u2019 preferences. Close to 80 people were our enemies. True numbers are unknown till date. Aayush, Aman and Ashutosh felt pretty confident since they had long foreseen the day and had practiced enough by booking tatkal tickets."

All of us except Devansh got selected in initial 50. We were excited as well as sad as Devansh wouldn\u2019t be joining us on the fun journey that lied ahead. But Devansh was determined to come with us and successfully convinced our RI convener at that time that he possessed the skills and desire to do RI at HIFEED, which was granted to him after some talks with HIFEED (2 students were allowed exceptionally, Aashka and Devansh). Fun fact:  When the list of selected students for HIFEED arrived, there were some student who registered twice to be secure. That\u2019s the reason why our poor Devansh couldn\u2019t got a chance initially._nl__nl_This easily came down as one of our best decisions as group"

He left us at a sign marking HIFEED ahead. _nl__nl_HIFEED (Himalayan Institution for Environment Ecology Development) is an organization that focuses on improving the lives of mountain communities. You can find more information about it at hifeed.org. It is a 1- minute drive from Chamba to HIFEED. Entering HIFEED is tough when you have a trolley bag with you as from the main road it is a 200 m trek which in some places is only 10 cm wide. So, for the first time it was tough for us also. Somehow, we managed to reach there. We got a 12-bed dormitory room which for the next 3-4 weeks, became our funhouse. So, we were divided into 5 teams to work on specific problems related to local issues. Most of us were in the same group of Mitigating Disaster Management in hilly regions. So, we needed to study the communities and come up with a solution that can help them to understand various calamities and help them to attenuate the damages done by it. "

So, the guide decided to start with whoever is present. So, we started running to catch the guide and colleagues before they got disappeared in the mountains but we were never able to find them. Instead we used technology to get going. Soon starting the late trip, we got divided into groups of 2-3 depending on the pace of the individuals. We communicated with the group ahead of us with the help of phones. Shrey was running last and soon gave up on the mountain trekking and headed back to HIFEED. Nisarg and Rutul were now running last but they did not lose hopes and were fast enough to catch Roshan and Aayush who were wandering on the road. As we travelled, we were got thirsty and found on a club on the road. Rutul dared to go inside and ask for the price of a water bottle. It was 60 Rs bottle and we decided dying of thirst would be better than purchasing the bottle so we continued the trekking by asking the directions from our preceding group. Shashank and Devansh \u2013 the two most fittest beings on the planet and consequently among us too were very well ahead in the lead. The roads were getting complicated as some of us were not sure whether we were going in the right directions. So, we asked Shashank and Devansh to wait for us. Luckily, we found them as by that time we were not knowing if it is the same mountain or not. Now we had enough manpower to find the hidden temple. But all we did was to follow Shashank as he had the instinct that it is the right direction. It was the right route and near to sunset, we reached the temple just to find out that the group had already begun descending the mountain from the other side. Now, we needed to reach Chamba from where jeep was ready to pick us up. In the meantime, we stopped at various places to click some pics as the views were beyond imagination. So, we reached Chamba just in the right time and we went back to HIFEED to call it a day."
