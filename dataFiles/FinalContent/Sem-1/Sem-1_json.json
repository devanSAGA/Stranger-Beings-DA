Rutul was the roommate of Devansh. Shrey and Aayush were on the same floor as Roshan and was the only other room for 2015-19 batch on E-mid. It is till date unknown how we met Aman and Ashutosh, we hypothesize that they were in lab groups of Aayush and Shrey respectively. Aagam met Nisarg since he was his lab partner. Chahak met us initially through Headrush and then later was officially instated as Roshan\u2019s roomie, which changed his views for us and the whole world! "
