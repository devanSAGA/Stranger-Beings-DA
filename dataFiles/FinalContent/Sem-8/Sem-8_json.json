To make this more happening, Shrey forced Panditji to keep his sister\u2019s marriage around the same time. So, we had marriage to attend on 6-7 May, then BTP presentations on 8-9 May and farewell on 9th night. Roshan and Nisarg came early. So, they were chilling at DA basically from 4th.\n\n8 among us planned to go to the marriage and it was around the same time that the site was supposed to be up. But last-minute procrastination + chaos ensured that we couldn\u2019t put it up. For going to Surendranagar (where the wedding was), we booked AC Train, so we wouldn\u2019t have to struggle in the heat. But we forgot the bag in cab and we only realized when the train arrived. So, two of us stayed back to collect the luggage and later came by bus in the heat. Purpose of non-struggling journey defeated. Also, they couldn\u2019t use their laptops to work on the journey.\n\nFinally, they reached at Surendranagar bus stand and were picked up by a driver, sent by Shrey who was very suspicious and they feared for life and sent messages all over as it looked like a classic case of kidnapping. But luckily, they reached the wedding place safely.\n\nAlthough, the main aim of coming to Surendranagar was to enjoy wedding, they also had BTP presentations coming after a day and just like our habits at DA, none of us, except Chahak made the presentation yet."
