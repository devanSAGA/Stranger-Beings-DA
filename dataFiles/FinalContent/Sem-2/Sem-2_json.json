            "desc": "All of us have changed plenty of phones during college life, and many of them have stories behind them. So here they are: \n\nShrey :\nAfter his 12th Board exams, he purchased an Intex Aqua. After coming to college, his phone broke. He spent around 4k and managed to put some life in that phone. Then after some time, It fell again but this time Shrey and phone both were broken. So he went to his relative guy for repairing, but that guy gave another phone instead, which he started using. \nOnce during dance practice, he broke Sajal's phone, so instead of giving him money for repairing, he bought that phone and started using it.\nHe damaged that phone at least 3-4 times and spent around another 6k on that. After that, for a short period of time, he was using his mother's phone which was practically unbreakable (not Nokia 3310 - as you'll see when you read Aagam's version). But, this time, he found another way by losing it somewhere in LT (He also filled police complaint for this phone). He finally bought MotoG4 and his life took a new turn and his journey towards happiness began.\n\nAagam:\nSo Aagam's first experience of phone-breaking was during a regular 2-3 AM CR in 1st year. Before CR, we were in the cafe and Aagam forgot his phone in the cafe. So we took it and hid it from him. He kept calling his phone during the whole CR, but of course, we kept it in silent mode. Then when he found out Rutul had his phone, he ran towards Rutul, so Rutul threw the phone towards Aagam assuming he will catch it, which, of course, he didn't and thr phone's screen broke completely. So he gave it for repairing and was using the Nokia 3310 (The Unbreakable Phone). Interestingly, he broke that also (no one knows how you could add how here, if someone knows). He then purchased a new phone which broke within 2 months. He used cellotape to repair it and is still using that.\n\nRutul:\nRutul also had one experience when he dropped his phone in water in Bengaluru during his internship and damaged it. But as he got the PPO, he doesn't have any regret about that incident.\n\nRoshan:\nDuring Uttarayan 2018, some of us gathered at Nisarg's place to enjoy kite flying together. During that, Roshan was standing near the terrace's wall and Shashank was flying kites passionately(as he is every time) and he hit Roshan on his hand and the phone fell down a couple of floors. He then bought Moto G5s plus and thank god, is still working properly.\nBut one time, he did forgot the phone in a private travels bus, which he got through Rutul, who collected it from the office.\n\nDevansh:\nDevansh damaged his first phone while brushing, where his phone fell in the basin. Then he bought Moto G3, but just 4 days prior to Moto G4 launch. So not only did he regret the basin incidence, but also the shopping timing for his new phone.\n\nShashank:\nShashank used to have a  Lenovo phone and was using it happily for around 1-1.5 years. But then the inevitable happened and someone stole his phone in his flight to USA. After that, he bought Moto G5s and used that for the rest of his college life. Also now he is the richest person in our group and is using iPhone XR.\n\nNisarg:\nNisarg had one of the sturdiest phones, so he used to flaunt-off by playing with it and dropping it on the floor on purpose\n\nOnce we all sat together and calculated the amount of money Aagam and Shrey had spent on their phones till date. Aagam won that battle, but we don't know if he celebrated that win or went to his room and cried like a mad man."
