It was dinner time and there was no sign of Shrey so Nisarg and Rutul decided to start to have dinner without him. So, they had chinese at Nanking, later followed by Gandhi Soda. Soon after Roshan joined them, Shrey's location was showing he reached so the guys went to pick him up from the bus stand. After picking him up they were stopped by Police for checking as it was almost new years and we looked like youngsters full of life (which we are minus the alcohol part). After the clearance, they went to Ratri Bazar (a place which opens up at Night) as Shrey was hungry from all the travelling. Shrey tried Pav Bhaji and Roshan had one of the best chats with hot dog guy. _nl__nl_The guys then went to Nisarg's home for the night. As late-night snacks they went to KGN bakery for freshly baked puffs. There is a secret pathway for that. The next day, they kick started their morning with Jalebi and Fafda. Later they went to eat Bun Samosa outside Baroda High School and then Vadodara\u2019s famous Mahakali Sev-usal and Pyarelal ni Kachori to tick few things off in bucket list. This not being enough, they also had ice cream and shake at Samrat Coldrink House. These all were iconic places. _nl__nl_After that they all went to zoo. The fun is at different level when you visit the zoo with friends (We have videos in the Video section to prove). Devansh joined them at zoo. Had fun moments with birds and animals! Just so that Rutul and Shrey didn\u2019t feel like they didn\u2019t fully visit the Kamatibaug, they took a toy-train ride covering more or less the whole Kamatibaug. Then it was time to play so that we can make some more room for more food. Next stop was Inorbit Mall for Bowling and from there directly to Sindhrot for Go-Karting, where Roshan crashed very badly and destroyed 10+ tyres kept as boundary.  _nl__nl_Even though it is very hard to cover all the food places in Vadodara in just one day, we tried our best! Next, we went to Vishal Samosa Sandwich to have delicious Cheese Samosa Sandwich accompanied by Tasty Vadapav. MarutiNandan soda was also nearby so we can\u2019t miss that. Maulik Chaudhary got tempted to join us as soon as he found out via our Instagram Stories. Next was Yo Frankie in Nizampura. Some of us had frankie there and others had hotdog at Frigtemp (Fatehgunj). Rutul had both. They ended their day with a delicious Gola from Shyaam Gola. _nl__nl_Rutul and Shrey had to leave next morning as prep and packing was also going on for their internship. They wanted to see Roshan's house and hospitality, so both of them stayed at his house. They enjoyed at night and then were stuffed with infinite food before leaving. Indian Moms \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af_nl__nl_We hope there is a part 3 to this series soon :')"
