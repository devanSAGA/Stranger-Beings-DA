But when everyone checked their schedules, many commitments were clashing. Finally, after trying to align our schedule as much as we can, we planned a 4-day trip including travelling time to Imagica, Matheran and Mumbai. We had slight idea of what we were going to do, but kept the plan free enough so we can change it at our will."

We wanted to book a place to stay for 2 days, but we were 8 people and it could get too costly in a hotel, so we tried airbnb for the first time. Got a nice place with all the amenities + pooool (OH YEAH). Airbnb doesn\u2019t display owner\u2019s information as you might buy directly from them and cut their share, so they provide a chat interface where you can talk with the owner and anything like links, phone numbers (even written in words) get masked. But we had a hell lot of queries and the chat system wasn\u2019t the most efficient way to communicate. So, the owner sent her number in Hindi (airbnb, didn\u2019t cover that. lol). Finally, we talked with her and finally booked bypassing airbnb as it was cheaper. Then, we booked a car to travel from Mumbai to Imagica and then Airbnb we booked and also booked Imagica tickets."

Aayush was supposed to join us from Mumbai. We boarded the train at night and got off at Borivali where Aayush and his mom were waiting for us. We had some breakfast there and then got on the car, where we played songs and talked a lot till Imagica arrived."

Devansh tried to shine out in this situation as a genius mind and threw the plastic carry-bag somewhere away to distract the monkeys. Not only monkeys didn\u2019t get distracted, but 3 ninja guys turned up from nowhere. They belonged to some youth committee and they said - \u201cwe spotted you throwing the plastic bag and thus we fined you (Devansh) for littering\u201d. While Devansh was saying sorry and negotiating with these guys Shashank was attacked by one monkey and he threw the bottle which went directly into the lake. Now these guys were asking 5000 more for polluting the lake. And as it was not enough, Rutul slipped from a slope like area and injured his foot. All of these happened in mere 3-5 minutes. After that Devansh paid the fine as it was already a lot of chaos and we went to a food stall nearby, where rutul\u2019s injury was dealt with and everybody stuffed themselves with vadapavs."

Aayush and Roshan turned a blind eye to Devansh feeling that he is joking like always. But then we stood in a team circle and discussed if it is surely Zakir, and then prepared a script that we would follow for a conversation. After all, not having conversation would look anti-\u2018social\u2019, on the other hand, we were only shy. But when we went to talk to him, we forgot the script and talked whatever came to our mind.
