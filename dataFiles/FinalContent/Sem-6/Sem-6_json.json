But this time the slots were such that we pondered upon taking a Communication Subject- Statistical Communication theory. Five of us played the gamble as from the course description document, it seemed most of it was going to be Probability, with which we were comfortable. The gamble payed of in the end, as we enjoyed the subject and took less stress than others + the labs were also fun. "

When Nisarg\u2019s name came, he was clueless and all of us were laughing while getting punished. He was more surprised by our stupidity than our sharing of codes!"

Sit there in front of him and do work. Daily attendance was taken.\n\nOver achiever Aayush Agrawal did his internship under ISRO where he build rockets, spacecrafts, PSLVs and everything under the sun (hahahahah, pun alert).We can say his internship was totally a rocket science(again, hahahahaha).\n\nand here comes the saddest part of our lives, Rutul leaving us all alone in the darkness. Rutul had got a 2 months summer internship at Amazon in\nBangalore. He used to work day and night so hard, to get pre placement offer. There used to be minimal contact between us and him.

Me and Roshan thought, well how big a cooler can be? And then it comes the gigantic metal cooler which requires at least two strong men just move it from one place to another. We changed the whole orientation of beds and tables in the room. No need to say Roshan\u2019s room continued being the go-to room for 'chilling'.
