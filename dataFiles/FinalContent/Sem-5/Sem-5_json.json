            "desc": "This was the first semester where we were required to choose electives. Most of us decided to take common courses. Introduction to Algorithms was taken by almost all of the batchmates and we were no exception. With too much research and feedbacks we chose Elements of Business Management and Graph theory as our two other electives. But after attending the first day, we did a complete 180-degree flip and finalized Logic for Computer Science (LCS) and Quantum Computation. Nisarg, Devansh and Aayush attended one lecture of LCS and all of the rest blindly followed their instincts to take LCS just on the faith of these fellows. No one ever dared to attend LCS lectures afterwards. A few brave souls like Aayush, Ashutosh, Aman and Jay still continued with Graph Theory."

That\u2019s when we started going aggressively to Reliance Chowkdi and Infocity. We ate there 4-5 times a week as compared to once in a week or two weeks before. Trying out new restaurants was itself an adventure that sometimes turned out to be good and sometimes bad. Slowly canteen became ineligible for dinner and Reliance Chowkdi became our own canteen."

The place was called, Zostel in Marol, Mumbai. It has hostel like dorms with much awesome beds at very reasonable rate! Devansh and Roshan almost fell for the place after looking at the great Mumbai Local Train themed doodling and Bollywood Minimalist Posters painted on the wall. The real fun began at night. As they noticed, the Zostel was famous among foreigners. Night Scene at Zostel was going like this - they had an amazing terrace where a budding band is playing old classic Bollywood songs, foreigners are enjoying the music with holding beer in one hand and weed in other. Since (unfortunately) none of us smoke/drink we were just sitting in the corner stumbling on mobile. And the lead singer of the band might have felt this insulting and gave the mic to Chahak and Devansh to sing for a while. Both of them slipped one by one by saying - \"Oh, I got a call, have to pick up this\". After a music night, there were few rounds of Cards Against Humanity and UNO arranged. Luckily, we were there on the Christmas Night, so got to enjoy these many events!"
