Almost every one stayed back on campus to sharpen their weapons before the final(well practically the psuedo-final) war began. The weather report was against us. Many warned us about the heat. But we decided to take on the challenge. Well it wasn't like we didn't have any options. Everyone was studying in the RC(Resource Centre with AC). But, for us, that was not an option as we like to talk, shout and make noise, and that wasn't allowed there. So, we moved our base camp to  the Project Lab(AC  enabled) where we were allowed to make atleast some noise. We stayed there whole day studying, watching movies, and matches. Aagam even brought his food dabbas, sat on the table and started eating, until the security guy saw that and stopped him.\n\nSince we used to study all night, there were times when we went to play football early in the  morning (mostly Natukaka-Bagha style football - only penalties), had Ghathiya at Gh-2 and Pohe at TCS for breakfast and then went to sleep for the rest of the day.\n\nAmazon was the first company to visit for internships. After the coding test, there were students who were expecting call for interviews based on their test performace and some who thought that that was it for them for Amazon. But when the list of selected students came out, many were surprised for not getting selected. There were also few students who were probably sleeping or eating or doing anything but expecting a call for interview, and they had to rush to the placement cell. They didn't even have their resume printed and had to send some friend for printing. Such was the chaos on the first day of our intership-drive."
